# Mount Hard Drive / Unmount Hard Drive
I have two drives installed in my Macbook, one SSD(for OS+software) and one Harddrive(for media files).
I want to Mount and Unmount the drive whenever I want. I want to unmount the Drive so it instantly spin down. This way I can save battery-time, reduce noise of my computer, and safely move around the laptop without worrying about destroying my harddrive.
Export the Scripts as Applications, and just launch them to Mount/Unmount the Hard drive.
RENAME THE DRIVE NAME IN THE SCRIPT TO YOUR DRIVE. MINE IS CALLED "Hard Drive"
